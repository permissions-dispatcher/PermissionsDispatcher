## FAQs

<!--
Before you add the issue, please make sure to read over the following Frequently Asked Questions:

**"XxxPermissionsDispatcher class is not generated"**

- Did you add `@RuntimePermissions` to your class, and `@NeedsPermission` to your method?
- Did you try a Rebuild? (Sync is not Rebuild!)
- Don't mix `apt` and `annotationProcessor`!
- If you're in Kotlin, use `kapt`!
- If you're using Realm 1.x., please consider upgrading to 2.x (refer to Issue #270: https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher/issues/270)
- If you checked all these steps, and the generated classes are still not showing up, then attach your Activity/Fragment class, and build.gradle.
