# PermissionsDispatcher [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/permissions-dispatcher/PermissionsDispatcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/permissions-dispatcher/PermissionsDispatcher)

- [**Kotlin support**](https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher/blob/master/doc/kotlin_usage.md)
- [**Special Permissions support**](https://github.com/hotchemi/PermissionsDispatcher/blob/master/doc/special_permissions.md)
- **100% reflection-free**

PermissionsDispatcher provides a simple annotation-based API to handle runtime permissions.

This library lifts the burden that comes with writing a bunch of check statements whether a permission has been granted or not from you, in order to keep your code clean and safe.

For more information please see [the website](https://permissions-dispatcher.github.io/).
